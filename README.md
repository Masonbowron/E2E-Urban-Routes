Home work project 8
This project was to create eight tests for Urban Routes website. These tests will be automated and checked as pass or fail by using Web Driver IO and JavaScript. To clean up the official page I have created Page Object Model to put all the locators and functions in that file. To verify the tests ran as intended I have added Expect functions to each test to check for appropriate repsonses of the website. To run all the test open up Terminal and type npm run wdio.
